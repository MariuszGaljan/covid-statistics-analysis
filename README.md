# covid-statistics-analysis
My analysis of COVID-19 spread data.

This program runs an analysis of the COVID-19 spread data in countries all aroud the world.
We have 3 exercises, each described in detail in exercises/exercise_X.py, where X is the number of the exercise.

For each exercise, the program queries the data from the connected database 
and plots the results for the user.

Although it's not a good practice to include data in the repository, I included a PostgreSQL database backup file in case you'd like to try it out yourself (though the application only requires a connection to a db. It will fill the rest from the CSV if needed).
